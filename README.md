🚀 Automated CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline where code changes pushed to a GitHub repository automatically trigger Jenkins to deploy a static website on an AWS EC2 instance running Nginx.

The pipeline removes manual deployment steps and ensures that every update is instantly reflected on the live website.


🧠 Architecture Overview
Local Machine → GitHub → Jenkins → AWS EC2 → Nginx → Browser

🎯 Project Objective

To implement an end-to-end CI/CD workflow using Jenkins that automatically deploys application code to a Linux server whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Git & GitHub – Source code management

Jenkins – CI/CD automation

AWS EC2 (Ubuntu) – Application server

Nginx – Web server

Linux – Server administration
